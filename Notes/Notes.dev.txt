we want like this:


```
vagrant@ubuntu-focal:~$ shasum --help
Usage: shasum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Print or check SHA checksums.
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

  -a, --algorithm   1 (default), 224, 256, 384, 512, 512224, 512256
  -b, --binary      read in binary mode
  -c, --check       read SHA sums from the FILEs and check them
      --tag         create a BSD-style checksum
  -t, --text        read in text mode (default)
  -U, --UNIVERSAL   read in Universal Newlines mode
                        produces same digest on Windows/Unix/Mac
  -0, --01          read in BITS mode
                        ASCII '0' interpreted as 0-bit,
                        ASCII '1' interpreted as 1-bit,
                        all other characters ignored

The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
      --ignore-missing  don't fail or report status for missing files
  -q, --quiet           don't print OK for each successfully verified file
  -s, --status          don't output anything, status code shows success
      --strict          exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
  -w, --warn            warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

  -h, --help        display this help and exit
  -v, --version     output version information and exit

When verifying SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256 checksums, indicate the
algorithm explicitly using the -a option, e.g.

  shasum -a 512224 -c checksumfile

The sums are computed as described in FIPS PUB 180-4.  When checking,
the input should be a former output of this program.  The default
mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating type
(`*' for binary, ` ' for text, `U' for UNIVERSAL, `^' for BITS),
and name for each FILE.  The line starts with a `\' character if the
FILE name contains either newlines or backslashes, which are then
replaced by the two-character sequences `\n' and `\\' respectively.
